# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary.
# The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
# Write a program that converts their scores to grades.
# By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should
# contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_
# grades dictionary will be checked.
